Script for Iterative BP-CNN

To use:
create "batch" directory inside of "Iterative-BP-CNN-master"
place "masterResearchScript.bat" there
run script from the command line!

Note:
when running main.py everything is logged to the log file
due to limitations with batch scripts i was unable to output to both the console and the log file
so dont worry when you dont see a bunch of stuff, you can check the log file and see that its all working properly (hopefully)
